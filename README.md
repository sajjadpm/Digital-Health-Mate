This Project focuses on the problems faced by the patients in tracking the Health reports and Health
Information taken over various hospitals and labs, which can be lost, that will be crucial in
identifying major diseases that may occur to the patient and in tracking down the overall Health.
Hence the need for a Life Saver for tracking down his health summary in a week, month or year
is most fruitful in the daily life. The person could share his health information & report easily with
his doctor, friend or relative easily in emergency situations The Paper discusses a Natural Reader
which can synthesis voice based on the textual input by the student or patient which help in forming
a better learning curve. The student can set the rate and the accent of the voice. It also includes a
Voice Assistance which can trigger various functions on the computer based on the power of
Human Voice. The Natural reader provides an efficient learning curve by synthesizing voice
replacing the textual words. The Voice Assistance provides increased independence in using
computing devices. Disabled people enjoy accessing computers without standard input devices
and uses hands-free computing through the use of speech recognition technologies. Thus this
initiative is aimed at helping human suffering from Learning disabilities, including dyslexia and
dysgraphia, repetitive strain injuries, physical disabilities and limited English proficiency and the
difficulties in using the modern computing device.
